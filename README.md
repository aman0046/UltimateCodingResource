# Ultimate RoadMap to start your coding journey

Before diving into DSA, make sure you have a solid understanding of basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, arrays, and functions.

## Programming Language
The first thing to start your coding journey is learn one of the basic programming language out of C++, Java or Python. (If you haven't start learning any of the language, will recommend you to go with C++)
